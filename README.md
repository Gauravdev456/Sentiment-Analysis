Title: **Twitter Sentiment Analysis on the Israeliâ€“Palestinian Conflict**

  This Twitter Sentiment Analysis project offers a nuanced exploration of public sentiment surrounding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict by leveraging data from the Twitter platform. The study reveals a multifaceted spectrum of opinions and emotional responses, providing a comprehensive understanding of sentiment fluctuations during pivotal conflict events.

**Approach:**
  The project utilizes Selenium for automation and scraping to collect relevant data from Twitter.

**Methodology:**
Two distinct models are employed to gain insights into the topic:

  **Rule-Based Model (VADER):**
  The project incorporates a rule-based sentiment analysis model, specifically VADER, to extract insights. This model enables the identification of sentiments based on predefined rules, offering a structured analysis of sentiment patterns.
  
  **NLP Model (RoBERTa):**
  Additionally, a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model, RoBERTa, is implemented. This model, based on transformer architecture, provides a more sophisticated analysis by understanding the contextual nuances of language. RoBERTa enhances the depth of sentiment analysis, capturing subtle variations in public opinions.

**Project Findings:**
  The project's findings present a detailed and dynamic portrayal of public sentiment, shedding light on the diverse range of opinions and emotional responses. By analyzing sentiment fluctuations during key conflict events, the study   contributes to a nuanced understanding of the ever-evolving landscape of public sentiment on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
